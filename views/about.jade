            I was an accounting major back in college. Worked
            for a couple years till I slowly picked up
            programming. I started off self-studying Python, and
            got good enough to write some basic scripts for work.
            My interest in web development got me into JavaScript.
            The elegance and sophistication of the language compelled
            me to learn Node.js as the foundation of my backend 
            development.
